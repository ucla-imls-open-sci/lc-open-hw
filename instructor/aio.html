<p>The challenges we are facing in the 21st century call for a more
democratic, collaborative, all hands on deck approach to science and
technology. But to participate in research, people need tools. Ideally,
tools that would allow anyone to locally pursue the research questions
they are seeking to answer.</p>
<p>During the last decade, following the ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" class="external-link">free
and open source software</a> and seizing the opportunities opened by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture" class="external-link">maker
movement</a>, more and more people started building their own tools for
research. Taking the “open” in open science one step further, they
release their creations or modifications under open licenses, sharing
them through different internet platforms so anyone can build, study,
modify, or commercialize them.</p>
<p>This practice, or “open science hardware (OSH)”, is growing
worldwide.</p>

<p>In their 2021 Open Science recommendation, UNESCO defines open

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Today, researchers in academia have a hard time making science
hardware work for their own needs. Science tools can be considered what
we call black boxes: we know what goes in and what we get back, but we
have limited or no information on their internal workings or design.
This is a significant problem for science in terms of reproducibility,
but it also has other consequences.</p>
<p>For scientists, black boxes are a problem because they make it
difficult to source, maintain and adapt tools to different needs.
Science often demands adapting experimental settings to new research
questions; collaborative research with communities or citizen science
projects often presents needs that were not originally conceived in the
design of science hardware. The lack of access to blueprints combined
with the niche, highly-specialized nature of science increases labs’
dependence on centralized vendors; only some can afford the extra costs
and delays.</p>
<p>Beyond customization, most of the tools used in research today are
unevenly distributed. Science infrastructure is usually available to
highly skilled experts, well-funded laboratories, and renowned
institutions in countries with high investments in science and
technology. For many scientists with limited budgets, access to the
tools for research is hampered by prohibitive import taxes, lack of
access to technical support, or inability to source spare parts. It
becomes even more difficult for those communities aiming to participate
in research in non-conventional settings, outside academia.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In this context, developing and using OSH gives researchers much
better control over their experiments, and access to research that
wouldn’t be possible with conventional proprietary instrumentation.</p>
<p>There are several benefits of OSH, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Research integrity:</strong> Research is inherently
iterative, where we always build on past knowledge. Making hardware
designs open source for others to study, peer review, reuse, and improve
demonstrates accountability and commitment to the scientific
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replicability:</strong> Open Source Hardware designs can
be replicated, allowing for verification and reproduction of experiments
and data. Moreover, users can have much better control on the
calibration of their devices, boosting replicability even
further.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Innovation:</strong> By making OSH designs open source,
others can collaborate on the design process leading to faster
development, better products, and a larger user base for OSH
instruments. Everyone benefits, as new designs do not need to start from
scratch and designers of original instruments get access to derivatives
of their work without having to develop things themselves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> OSH can make research more
accessible, inclusive and diverse as the availability of designs allow
anyone, anywhere to replicate and use hardware to test emerging ideas,
and collect data, independently from who and/or where they are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> OSH allows researchers to quickly
put together designs to test new research questions in an accessible
way. With less risk, researchers can explore a new direction before
committing more resources or using shared facilities that imply greater
bureaucracy. Using rapid prototyping tools and open source licences
scientists can adapt their experiments to their needs, and share these
changes so others can do the same.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parallelisation:</strong> Given the general fairer price
point of OSH, the same budget that allows for the purchase of one
proprietary device, normally enables the purchase/building of several
equivalent OSH designs. This potentially enables much faster data
collection and even collection of certain types of data that would be
too cumbersome to do in a serial manner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> OSH designs can be more
sustainable than proprietary products because they can be repaired and
modified, extending the lifespan of the product and reducing waste. And
in the case of the supplier going out of business, users and/or third
party companies can keep systems running.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Education:</strong> OSH designs can be a valuable
educational tool, allowing students and researchers to learn from it,
and fully understand how a certain tool is capable of capturing data on
specific phenomena/events. This in turn opens up the opportunity for the
design of better experiments and better control of data being output by
equipment.</p></li>

<p>How does OSH align with FAIR principles?</p>
<p>People in the community are working towards alignment with FAIR, to
make OSH: - Findable: Projects are shared with searchable metadata on
open platforms. - Accessible: Designs are available online under open
licenses—no paywalls or restrictions. - Interoperable: Uses standard,
widely accepted formats like STL or CSV, and modular designs that work
well with other systems. - Reusable: Complete documentation and clear
licensing make it easy for others to build, adapt, and improve on the
work.</p>

<p><strong>ACCESS</strong> - It makes science tools available to more
people: Just like libraries help people access books and info for free,
OSH makes lab equipment and tools available without needing to buy
expensive commercial stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Helps level the playing field: A small university or school with
limited funds can build tools using OSH designs, giving more people a
chance to do real science.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourages learning by doing: Since people can build and modify
the hardware, it’s like having hands-on learning resources, which
libraries often promote.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports community-driven knowledge: OSH is often built and
improved by communities, similar to how libraries value sharing
knowledge openly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PRESERVATION</strong> - It documents everything: OSH projects
usually include manuals, design files, parts lists, etc. That makes them
easy to reproduce and store—just like libraries archive useful
information.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It keeps knowledge from disappearing: If a company stops making a
tool, you’re stuck. But if it’s open, the design still exists and can be
reused or repaired later.</p></li>
<li><p>Formats and licenses make reuse easier :Like how libraries like
open formats (PDF, CSV, etc.), OSH encourages using accessible formats
and clear licenses, so designs can be preserved and reused
easily.</p></li>
<li><p>People can adapt and remix the designs: like preserving not just
the object, but the idea behind it—so others can build new things from
the old.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s sustainable: by enabling repairs and upgrades instead of
throwing things away, OSH supports long-term use and reduces
waste—something libraries increasingly care about.</p></li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Open science hardware is created through a variety of pathways,
reflecting the wide range of people and institutions engaged in science.
As a result, documentation can be found in multiple, and often
non-academic, publication venues.</p>
<p>Some designs emerge from DIY or maker communities, where individuals
use accessible digital fabrication tools—such as 3D printers or
microcontrollers—to develop low-cost, adaptable solutions. Other
hardware originates in academic and research institutions, often in
response to specific scientific needs. In these cases, researchers may
document and share their work through scholarly publications or
institutional repositories.</p>
<p>There are also collaborative efforts, such as hackathons or
international gatherings like GOSH (Gathering for Open Science
Hardware), where interdisciplinary teams co-develop tools with input
from scientists, engineers, educators, and community members. These
communities often run their own forums, where documentation can be found
either in repositories or websites/wikis.</p>
<p>Finally, some commercial initiatives have adopted open hardware
principles, releasing product designs under open licenses to foster
community engagement and innovation. In these cases, a company website
is probably the best source of information on that specific open
hardware design.</p>

<p>Open science hardware projects, like other research tools, typically
begin with a clear problem or need identified by the researcher or
developer. This need is gradually translated into desired features—the
specific functions or capabilities the hardware should offer.</p>
<p>With access to affordable rapid prototyping tools such as Arduino
boards, laser cutters, or 3D printers, researchers can now create and
test multiple hardware concepts quickly. These early iterations are used
to explore technical possibilities and gather feedback from potential
users.</p>
<p>For librarians supporting researchers, it’s helpful to recognize that
open hardware development is often iterative. A researcher may begin
with a simple prototype—something functional but rough—that allows them
to experiment with certain features. Through multiple cycles of testing
and improvement, a more stable version may emerge.</p>
<p>At this stage, the design may be called a demonstrator: it works and
meets the intended need, but may still require manual adjustments, lacks
full documentation, or depends on custom parts. Only after thorough
refinement, testing, and documentation does the hardware reach the stage
of a product—something that others can reliably build or even
manufacture.</p>

<p>While most OSH documentation begins once the design reaches the

<p>Documenting decisions, trade-offs, and failed experiments can benefit
others in the community and foster a culture of transparency and
learning. As librarians, encouraging researchers to share early—and
helping them organize and preserve that documentation—can play a key
role in making hardware development more collaborative, discoverable,
and reproducible.</p>

<p>In the context of open science, sharing hardware goes beyond
publishing a paper or uploading a schematic. Librarians can play a key
role in guiding researchers toward comprehensive documentation
practices, ensuring that shared hardware is both reproducible and
impactful.</p>
<p>For a design to be truly open and reusable, it must include a
comprehensive set of materials. The core “source” in open hardware
typically consists of what we call design files that describe how the
hardware is built.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the hardware, the design files can include
circuit diagrams, CAD models, layout plans, files for 3D-printing or
more. If the project includes programmable elements, source code or
firmware should also be shared.</p>
<p>Open hardware should include a detailed bill of materials (BOM),
outlining every component needed, along with technical specifications
and sources. Assembly instructions, often with visual aids or videos,
guide users through construction and setup. Well-documented projects
often include information on testing and calibration, helping users
assess the tool’s performance.</p>
<p>All these elements should be accompanied by clear and open licensing,
ensuring that others can legally reuse, adapt, and redistribute the
work.</p>

<p>While efforts to standardize how open science hardware is documented,
discovered, and evaluated have grown over the past decade, significant
challenges remain—many of which are directly relevant to librarians
supporting researchers.</p>
<p>Since the OSH definition was first introduced, various initiatives
have worked to align practices around openness. In reality, however,
implementations across projects and organizations still vary widely.</p>
<p>One of the core challenges lies in differing interpretations of what
“open” means in practice. It’s not unusual to encounter projects that
are technically open-licensed but lack the necessary design files, build
instructions, or supporting information to enable real reuse.</p>
<p>For librarians, this poses a key concern: a license alone does not
guarantee accessibility or usability. Without proper documentation,
researchers may struggle to replicate or build upon existing work,
limiting the collaborative and inclusive potential of open hardware.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Licensing is a critical part of making hardware “open.” For
researchers working on open science hardware (OSH), selecting an
appropriate open license—or understanding one that’s already in use—can
determine whether a design is reusable, modifiable, and legally
shareable. As librarians, you can help researchers make informed
decisions about how to license their work or how to assess the
reusability of existing designs.</p>
<p>Open source licenses are legal tools that define how others can use,
modify, and distribute a project. In open science hardware, licenses
perform two key functions: they guarantee user freedoms and set the
conditions under which those freedoms are granted. These licenses
originate in the free and open-source software (FOSS) movement and have
since been adapted for hardware contexts.</p>
<p>Open licenses are not the same as placing something in the public
domain. While public domain tools like Creative Commons Zero (CC0) waive
all rights, open licenses retain copyright but grant specific
permissions, usually with obligations—such as requiring attribution or
ensuring derivatives remain open. This structure fosters collaboration
while protecting the author’s intentions.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Unlike software, open hardware projects combine multiple types of
materials: physical designs, documentation, firmware, and often
branding. This makes licensing more complex. It’s not uncommon to find a
project labeled “open” that uses a valid open license for its
documentation, but offers no instructions or files to actually reproduce
the hardware.</p>
<p>Licenses for OSH fall into two broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copyleft licenses (like CERN-OHL-S or TAPR OHL) require that any
modifications or derived designs are also shared openly under the same
terms. These are useful when a researcher wants to ensure that
improvements remain part of the commons.</li>
<li>Permissive licenses (like Solderpad or CERN-OHL-P) allow for reuse
with minimal restrictions, including commercial use and incorporation
into proprietary designs. These can help maximize adoption but don’t
require that others contribute improvements back.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CERN Open Hardware Licence (OHL) is currently one of the most
widely recommended licenses in OSH. Its three variants—strongly
reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S), weakly reciprocal (CERN-OHL-W), and permissive
(CERN-OHL-P)—allow researchers to choose the level of openness and
control they’re comfortable with.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/lic.png" alt="Permission overview for software licences, from The Turing Way" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Permission overview for software licences, from
The Turing Way</div>
</figure><p>When helping a researcher choose a license or evaluate an existing
one, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the license clearly allow use, modification, and
redistribution?</li>
<li>Is the license compatible with the researcher’s goals—e.g., wide
adoption, community building, or commercial integration?</li>
<li>Does the project apply the license consistently to all parts of the
work (hardware design files, software/firmware, documentation,
branding)?</li>
<li>Is attribution required, and are there clauses about how derivatives
must be shared?</li>
</ul>
<p>For projects aiming for certification, the <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/" class="external-link">OSHWA Certification Program</a>

component—hardware, software, documentation, and branding—and helps
clarify the distinction between open and partially open projects.</p>

<p>Many OSH projects still use software licenses (like GPL or MIT) or
Creative Commons licenses without fully understanding their implications
for hardware. This can lead to confusion or legal uncertainty. For
example, Creative Commons licenses aren’t designed for functional
objects, and standard software licenses might not account for physical
reproduction or patent rights.</p>
<p>We should encourage researchers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a hardware-specific license (e.g. CERN OHL or
Solderpad).</li>
<li>Be explicit about which license applies to which component of their
project.</li>
<li>Avoid mixing incompatible licenses.</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Open hardware designs are shared through a variety of platforms and
channels, chosen depending on the project’s goals and audience.</p>
<p>Online code repositories such as <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" class="external-link">GitLab</a> are among the most common
spaces, offering version control, collaboration features, and easy file
sharing. These repositories are the standard in software development,
and will be easily accessible to some researchers but not to most of
them. A good README file or website associated with the repository is
necessary to ensure broad accessibility.</p>
<p>Some platforms like <a href="http://Hackaday.io" class="external-link">Hackaday.io</a> or
<a href="https://wikifactory.com/platform/" class="external-link">Wikifactory</a> offer
dedicated hosting for hardware designs. These are often websites where
makers and scientists can showcase their work and receive feedback from
peers. Specific communities, like biohacking ones, run their own Wikis.
These are more accessible than repositories, but if they don’t point to
them they may lack essential information (such as version control).</p>
<p>Academic journals also play an important role: publications such as
<a href="https://www.hardware-x.com/" class="external-link">HardwareX</a> or the <a href="https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/openhardware" class="external-link">Journal of Open
Hardware</a> allow researchers to publish peer-reviewed articles that
include design files and documentation. In recent years, traditional
journals have started accepting open science hardware as part of their
scope. This means that you may find <a href="https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.385729" class="external-link">open hardware</a> designs for
microscopy in journals such as <a href="https://opg.optica.org/boe/" class="external-link">Biomedical Optics Express</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, some institutions maintain their own open access
repositories, where staff and students can deposit hardware designs
alongside datasets or publications. The <a href="https://www.ohwr.org/" class="external-link">Open Hardware Repository (OHR)</a> at CERN
is an early example of a platform where engineers and scientists share
designs for scientific instruments under open licenses, making it a
valuable resource for librarians seeking high-quality, peer-tested
hardware documentation.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>When assessing whether an open hardware project follows best
practices, librarians can guide researchers by focusing on a few
essential elements. The first and most critical is documentation.</p>
<p>A good open science hardware (OSH) project should include all the
necessary files—such as design schematics, bills of materials (BOM),
assembly instructions, and source code where relevant. This
documentation should be clear, complete, and accessible to users who are
not part of the original development team. Without it, the project may
be difficult or impossible to reproduce.</p>
<p>Another key element is licensing. A project is not truly open unless
it is accompanied by a recognized open license, such as the CERN Open
Hardware Licence (OHL). This license ensures that users are legally
permitted to reuse, adapt, and redistribute the design. Clear licensing
also builds trust and signals a commitment to openness and
collaboration.</p>
<p>Importantly, librarians should also consider the development stage of
the design. Is the project an early-stage prototype, a more stable
demonstrator, or a market-ready product? This distinction affects how
usable the project is in practice.</p>
<p>A prototype may offer valuable insights but might not yet be fully
documented or reproducible. A product-level design, on the other hand,
should be well-tested, standardized, and ready for others to adopt with
minimal modifications. Recognizing where a project sits along this
spectrum helps manage expectations and guides the kind of support or
caution librarians might offer to researchers exploring reuse.</p>
<div id="callout2" class="callout">

</div>
<div class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Callout</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Academics often reuse, develop and publish open hardware prototypes.
This is because most use open science hardware to test new ideas, and
appreciate the flexibility it provides. On the other hand, researchers
can also be final users of open science hardware. In this case, they may
not be interested in development, but looking for final products that
ensure they are safe and reliable enough to generate good data.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, signs of community engagement—such as active GitHub issues,
user feedback, or visible updates—can indicate that a project is
maintained and evolving. Evidence of testing or calibration data further
strengthens confidence in the hardware’s reliability. And, as with any
research tool, accessibility matters: designs that rely on widely
available and affordable components are more likely to be usable across
diverse settings. By combining these criteria, librarians can help
researchers identify open hardware projects that are not only open in
theory but truly usable in practice.</p>

<p>In addition to knowing where to find and evaluate open science
hardware (OSH) projects, librarians can play a proactive role in helping
researchers prepare their own designs for sharing. Before choosing a
platform or writing documentation, researchers benefit from structured
reflection on what they are sharing, why, and for whom.</p>
<p>Librarians can support this process by asking a few targeted
questions that clarify the project’s goals and readiness. For example:
Is the hardware functional and tested? Is the documentation complete and
understandable to someone outside the lab? Does the researcher want
community contributions, visibility, citations, or potential commercial
uptake?</p>
<p>These early conversations can also surface issues that may otherwise
go unnoticed, such as gaps in attribution, unclear licensing, or ethical
concerns related to safety or misuse. For instance, a researcher may be
unsure whether their design is eligible for open licensing, or may want
to restrict certain uses without knowing how to reflect that in a
license. Others may be unclear about whether internal documentation (lab
notes, partial prototypes) should be included.</p>
<p>Readiness conversations are an opportunity to align expectations and
introduce best practices from the start. If a researcher wants their
design to be used by others, then thinking early about documentation
structure, file formats, and accessibility will save effort down the
line.</p>
<p>Basic recommendations such as using plain-language README files,
ensuring bill of materials are clearly sourced, and publishing in open,
editable formats can be helpful early on a project. Beyond discovery and
curation of open science hardware, librarians can help researchers make
their work not just open, but useful, transparent, and inclusive.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>As we’ve seen in previous lessons, researchers engage with open
science hardware (OSH) in different ways—sometimes as developers
creating new tools, and sometimes as users looking for ready-to-use
solutions. Understanding this distinction helps librarians tailor their
support, whether that means guiding a researcher through licensing and
documentation or helping them assess whether an existing tool meets
their needs. Two examples will help clarify these situations.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Liu: Open science hardware as a research prototype</em></p>
<p>Dr. Liu, a biomedical engineering professor, is designing a custom
fluorescence imaging system to study bacterial colonies. Commercial
systems are too expensive and don’t support the specific wavelengths her
research requires.</p>
<p>To solve this, her lab builds a working prototype using open-source
components: 3D-printed mounts, Arduino boards, and open-source image
capture software. The system works well for testing ideas, but it’s not
production-grade—it requires manual calibration and includes fragile
parts.</p>
<p>Still, Dr. Liu considers the design to be useful and publishes the
design files and experimental results on GitHub under an open license.
This enables others to build on her work, refine the system, or apply it
in related contexts. As a developer, Dr. Liu is contributing to the OSH
ecosystem by openly sharing a prototype that reflects her research needs
and invites further collaboration.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Khan: Open science hardware as a research tool</em></p>
<p>In contrast, Dr. Khan, a plant biologist, needs a reliable
field-deployable system to monitor soil moisture in her
drought-resistance trials. She’s not interested in designing new
hardware—she wants something she can use right away with confidence in
its performance.</p>
<p>She finds a well-documented OSH project created by another lab,
complete with calibration data, a weatherproof casing, and clear
instructions. Because the design is stable and has been tested in
real-world conditions, she’s able to build and deploy it with minimal
adaptation. In this scenario, Dr. Khan is acting as a user, relying on
the maturity and reproducibility of the hardware to generate
high-quality data.</p>

<p>Recognizing whether a researcher is seeking an adaptable prototype or

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Even when researchers are enthusiastic about open hardware, they may
be unsure how to participate in existing communities. As a librarian,
you can encourage them by normalizing engagement as part of the research
process and highlighting accessible entry points.</p>
<p>Many communities are beginner-friendly and value a wide range of
contributions—not just technical expertise. A researcher might:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a question on a forum about replicating a tool.</li>
<li>Comment on an open design they’ve used or tested.</li>
<li>Share how they adapted an open design to a new context (e.g., for
fieldwork or teaching).</li>
<li>Report bugs or suggest documentation improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>These contributions help others and are often welcomed as meaningful
engagement, even if they don’t involve new inventions. You can also
encourage researchers to attend virtual gatherings or community calls,
where they can meet others working on similar challenges and learn how
knowledge and tools circulate outside traditional publication
venues.</p>
<p>Reminding researchers that OSH communities are collaborative—not
competitive—spaces can reduce hesitation and help build confidence. You
might suggest starting with a “lurking” phase (reading discussions,
reviewing existing posts), followed by small contributions, and
eventually deeper participation if they feel comfortable.</p>
