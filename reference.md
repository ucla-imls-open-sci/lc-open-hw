## Glossary

Arduino – A popular open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software, often used for prototyping scientific tools.

BOM (Bill of Materials) – A comprehensive list of components, parts, and materials required to build a piece of hardware, often including quantities, specifications, and sourcing details.

Black box – A system or device whose internal workings are not visible or accessible, limiting transparency and reproducibility in research.

CAD (Computer-Aided Design) – Software tools used to create precise drawings and models for hardware designs, often used in open hardware documentation.

CERN-OHL (CERN Open Hardware Licence) – A family of licenses designed for open hardware, with variants that determine how modifications must be shared (Strong, Weak, or Permissive).

Copyleft license – A type of license that requires any derivative works to be shared under the same open terms, preserving openness downstream (e.g. CERN-OHL-S).

Creative Commons (CC) – A suite of public licenses often used for documentation or media, but not always suitable for functional hardware.

Demonstrator – A prototype that has been tested and refined but may still lack full documentation or require manual adjustments. It is not yet ready for direct reuse without support.

Documentation – The written and visual materials that explain how to build, use, and understand a piece of open hardware. Good documentation is critical for reusability.

FAIR Principles – A framework for data and knowledge sharing: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. OSH aligns with FAIR by promoting transparency and reuse.

Firmware – Low-level software embedded in hardware devices that controls their functions. Often included in OSH projects.

FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) – A foundational movement advocating for the free use, modification, and sharing of software—its values inform open hardware licensing.

GitHub/GitLab – Online platforms for sharing code and hardware files, with version control and collaboration features. Commonly used in open science hardware projects.

Hackaday.io – A community platform for sharing hardware projects, often used by makers and DIY scientists.

License (open) – A legal tool that defines how a project can be used, modified, and redistributed. Open licenses promote freedom and clarity.

Maker movement – A cultural trend emphasizing hands-on innovation, DIY technology, and peer production, often intersecting with open science hardware.

Modular design – An approach to building hardware using standardized, interchangeable components, which facilitates reuse and adaptation.

OSH (Open Science Hardware) – Physical tools used for scientific research that are shared openly, including design files, documentation, and licensing.

OSHWA (Open Source Hardware Association) – An organization that promotes open hardware, provides a certification program, and offers licensing guidance.

Permissive license – A license that allows broad reuse, including commercial and proprietary applications, without requiring derivatives to be shared openly (e.g. CERN-OHL-P).

Platform (repository) – An online space where hardware designs and documentation are shared, such as OSF, Wikifactory, or the CERN Open 
Hardware Repository.

Prototype – An early-stage version of a hardware tool, used to test features and ideas. Typically rough and not fully documented.

Public Lab – A community and platform focused on environmental and community science, promoting open hardware and participatory methods.

README – A basic file in most OSH projects that provides an overview of the project, how to build or use it, and where to find related resources.

Reproducibility – The ability to repeat an experiment or rebuild a hardware tool using the same materials and procedures, essential for scientific rigor.

Replicability – The extent to which a tool or experiment can be reproduced independently with the same results, often used interchangeably with reproducibility.

Schematic – A diagram that represents the elements and connections in an electronic circuit, often part of OSH documentation.

Solderpad License – A permissive open hardware license based on Apache 2.0, tailored for ease of reuse in hardware contexts.

TAPR OHL – One of the earliest open hardware licenses, developed within the amateur radio community to ensure reciprocal sharing.

Wikifactory – A collaborative platform for sharing and co-developing physical products, with support for hardware versioning and documentation.
